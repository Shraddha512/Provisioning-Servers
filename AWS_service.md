Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)
=================================

These are scalable queues which let you store messages as they transmit between computers. By using this we can move messages between different components of a distributed application. It minimizes your chances of losing the data. The components don't need to be available during this process. This decouples the components from the temporary storage of messages. It holds the messages generated by one component, and about to be consumed by another component. It ensures delivery of messages. Tradeoff is that it does not guarantee FIFO behavior of queues. There can be multiple readers and writers. Access control can also be applied.
